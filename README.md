# Linear-Regression-Algorithm-From-Scratch
In this project I constructed a linear regression algorithm from the ground up, providing a hands-on experience in building a fundamental machine learning model. Linear regressions stands as one of the most widely utilized models in the field, and delving into its inner workings enhanced my ability to apply it with precision
